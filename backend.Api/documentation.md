üö¶ 1Ô∏è‚É£ MVP Scope Definition
Goal: Enable riders to request rides, drivers to accept them, and admins to manage tenants.

Must-have MVP features:

Rider registration/login

Driver registration/login

Request ride (rider)

Accept ride (driver)

Basic trip tracking (start/end)

Fare calculation (fixed/km)

Payment (initially cash, card/paystack/stripe later)

Tenant management (each company as a tenant)

üõ†Ô∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Services in .NET
Use Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API layers) for maintainability.

A. Core Services to Build:
Authentication Service (AuthService)

JWT authentication

Refresh tokens

Multi-tenant user management

User Management Service

CRUD for Riders & Drivers

Profile management

Driver verification status

Tenant Management Service

Register tenant (e.g., different fleet owners)

Tenant-level configuration (pricing, commission)

Multi-tenancy isolation using:

Schema-based multi-tenancy

Or discriminator-based with TenantId in all tables

Ride Request Service

Create ride request

Match driver

Track ride status (requested, accepted, on trip, completed, cancelled)

Basic location tracking (store pickup, dropoff)

Pricing & Fare Service

Base fare + distance/time fare

Promo codes (later phase)

Cancellation fee logic

Notification Service

Push notifications (via Firebase for Flutter)

In-app notifications

SMS notifications (later)

Payment Service (Phase 2 if too heavy for MVP)

Cash payments initially

Integrate Paystack/Stripe for card payment

Handle wallet/balance for drivers

Admin Dashboard Service

View rides

View users (riders/drivers)

Tenant configurations

üèóÔ∏è 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Design (EF Core + PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
Tables:

Users (Riders/Drivers with discriminator)

Tenants

RideRequests

RideStatuses

Payments

Vehicles

Locations (or store directly on RideRequest)

Multi-tenancy strategies:

Add TenantId to all tables for filtering

Use EF Core Global Query Filters

Optionally, schema-based per tenant if scaling demands

üì≤ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Flutter Frontend MVP Features
Rider App:
Login/Sign Up

Request ride (map + pickup/drop-off entry)

View driver details when assigned

Trip status updates (driver en route, on trip, completed)

Trip history

Driver App:
Login/Sign Up

Accept ride requests

View rider info

Start/end trip

View trip history

(Optional) Admin Mobile:
Basic overview of active trips and users per tenant

üåê 5Ô∏è‚É£ APIs to Expose
POST /api/auth/login

POST /api/auth/register

POST /api/rides/request

POST /api/rides/{id}/accept

POST /api/rides/{id}/start

POST /api/rides/{id}/complete

GET /api/rides/history

POST /api/tenants/register

GET /api/tenants/{id}/config

‚öôÔ∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure
‚úÖ Use:

ASP.NET Core Web API

EF Core with migrations

Redis (optional) for caching driver locations

Firebase for push notifications

GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for CI/CD

Docker for deployment consistency

üöÄ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements Post-MVP
Realtime location updates using SignalR/WebSockets

Dynamic driver-rider matching algorithms

Payment gateway integration

Surge pricing

Ratings & reviews

Driver earnings dashboard

Advanced trip analytics

In-app chat

Advanced multi-tenancy billing

üóÇÔ∏è Development Order
1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up clean backend structure with Tenant, User, and Auth modules.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Ride Request and Matching (without real-time initially).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement simple trip lifecycle (request ‚Üí accept ‚Üí start ‚Üí complete).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Flutter app: basic login, map pickup/drop-off, request, and view trip status.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Add notifications for driver assignment and status updates.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Implement basic admin API for monitoring.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate payment (optional if you want to ship faster).

If you want, I can generate:
‚úÖ Sample .NET folder structure for this architecture.
‚úÖ Seed data scripts for Tenants & Users.
‚úÖ Sample Flutter state management structure for your rider/driver app.
‚úÖ Postman collection for testing your API during development.
